ECAASU 2013 Website:

User Experience:
The site UX is unorthodox in that the main site where all the information is presented is one massive page. Each "page" on this index page is actually a frame that is set to 100% width and height through CSS3. The user travels from frame to frame using the links on the fixed header bar on the dropdown menu. These links, instead of redirecting to alternate pages, call a travel function that causes the screen to scroll relatively rapidly to the target frame. 

For example, the user types in ecaasu2013.org and sees the homeframe with the ECAASU 2013 logo, minimizable announcement bar, links to the four types of content areas, and the fixed header bar. The user wants to get some information on the workshops of the conference. The user then clicks on the workshops link on the drop down menu for "Program" on the header and the screen scrolls to the Workshops "page" which is actually a frame that emmulates a page.

In terms of graphic design, the colored lines that are placed between frames imitates the subway lines of the NYC MTA (especially the colors) and the travel function hence seeks to imitate subway motion. Links on the announcement bar will also call the travel function. 

On the header, the registration link, hotel registration link, and contact us link will all lead to actually separate pages.

The reason there are so many seemingly random pages in this site implementation is that many are designed to be stand-alone pages that aren't accessible to users from the main site. We utilize these through direct links in email, facebook, and twitter blasts, so these pages aren't actually part of the typical user experience flow.
